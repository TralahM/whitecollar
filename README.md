TralahTek is a global leader in mobile capture and digital identity verification solutions built on the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.

Project Whitecollar is an infrastructural solution that addresses existing identity management and information exchange issues in any areas and industries that require secure identity data and credentials exchange.

By implementing Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology, we introduce a new ecosystem for decentralised digital identity management that ensures:

- Trust and Compliance with the existing and upcoming regulations
- Ability to process most complex identity structures and workflows for corporate businesses
- Complete control over digital identities for data owners
- Reduction of data exchange costs.
- We work on establishing the platform to serve indefinite numbers of corporate and other business processes for B2B and looking for technology gurus to work on our complex FinTech/TechReg/LegalTech topics and who, like us, want to see these marvellous technologies (SSI: DID, VC, DIDCOMM, Smart Legal Contracts) around, in daily life.
